# diagnostic_simple_watchdog

This package provides a simple way to add diagnostics to a ROS node, by adding
a watchdog to its topics.

Currently, this package only supports ROS1 (noetic).

## How to use

See examples in [./launch](./launch).
It is as simple as to load a couple of parameters and run the node.

## TODO

- Add unit tests
- More documentation
